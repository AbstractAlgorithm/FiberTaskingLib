Fiber Tasking Lib
====================

This is a library for creating task-based multi-threading.
It uses fibers in order to support task graphs with task dependencies
Dependencies are represented as atomic counters


This library was created as a proof of concept of the ideas presented by
Christian Gyrling in his 2015 GDC Talk 'Parallelizing the Naughty Dog Engine Using Fibers'
